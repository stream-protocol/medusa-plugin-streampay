## Introduction

The Stream Payment Plugins for Medusa provide a powerful solution for extending and enhancing the web3 payment capabilities within the Medusa e-commerce platform. This repository contains a set of plugins that seamlessly integrate with Medusa's core, enabling you to take advantage of advanced payment features without the need for separate server resources or infrastructure.

The Stream Payment Plugins for Medusa provide an efficient and integrated solution to enhance web3 payments functionality within the Medusa platform.

Unlike traditional commerce solutions that require the development of separate web applications for extending features, our architecture offers a streamlined approach. Our plugins operate within the same process as the core system, eliminating the need for additional server resources, infrastructure, and ongoing maintenance. This architecture not only ensures optimal resource utilization but also allows plugins to seamlessly utilize all other services as dependencies and gain access to the database.

This integrated approach empowers you to build upon existing functionality while maintaining a cohesive and efficient ecosystem.

With Stream Payment Plugins, you can tap into the full potential of web3 payments within Medusa, providing an enhanced experience for users and streamlining your development efforts.
