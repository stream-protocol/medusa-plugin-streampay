The `StreamPay.sol` smart contract to use the latest Solidity version and added an escrow account and wallet functionality. In this smart contract version, funds are initially deposited into an escrow account and can be withdrawn by the recipient or refunded to the payer based on certain conditions. Smart contract:

In this StreamPay smart coontract Ethereum version, we have introduced the following changes:

1. Added an `escrow` address that holds the funds initially.

2. Introduced a state machine with states `Active`, `Paused`, and `Completed`. The owner can pause, resume, and complete the payment stream.

3. Added a refund functionality that allows the owner to refund the remaining balance to the payer when the payment stream is completed and the balance exceeds a specified threshold (`refundThreshold`).

4. Modified the `withdraw` function to check if the payment stream is active before allowing withdrawals by the recipient.

5. The `receive` function now checks if the payment stream is active before accepting payments.

Please note that this is a more complex contract, and thorough testing and auditing are essential before deploying it on the Ethereum blockchain.
